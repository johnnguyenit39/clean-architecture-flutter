"In the project, refer to the launch.json file in the .vscode/ directory for configuration settings related to building the application. The configurations are divided into two environments: development and production. Environment configuration management is achieved through the use of the .env library, which is excluded from the versioned codebase for security reasons.

The project follows the clean architecture principles, utilizing the Dio library for making HTTP requests along with interceptors for request management. Reusable components have been created for common functionality. The repository layer employs BLoC and Cubit patterns for state management. Additionally, the repository includes unit tests that cover essential scenarios.
